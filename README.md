# Chronicling-America-Parser

Solr URL Changes:

In the parser directory - the file `articleToDB.py`, on line 144, ensure that the link to Solr is correct - this must be done every time Solr is taken down and brought back up. More information available in the parser's readme document.

To start the Solr instances after the URLs have changed, view the `Solr Notes` pdf in the `Servers (Solr & Web)` folder in the Google Drive.
